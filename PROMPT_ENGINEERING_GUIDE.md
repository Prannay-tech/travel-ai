# Prompt Engineering Guide for Travel AI

This guide shows you exactly where to customize the AI prompts and model parameters for optimal travel planning conversations.

## üîë **Step 1: Add Your Groq API Key**

### **Where to add the API key:**
File: `clean_backend/.env`

```bash
# Replace "your-groq-api-key-here" with your actual Groq API key
GROQ_API_KEY=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
```

### **How to get a Groq API key:**
1. Visit https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate your API key
4. Copy the key and paste it in the `.env` file

## üéØ **Step 2: Customize the AI System Prompt**

### **Location:** `clean_backend/main.py` (lines 75-90)

The main system prompt is defined in the `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable. Here's the current prompt:

```python
AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert AI travel planner. Your job is to help users plan their perfect trip by extracting their travel preferences from natural language conversations.

Key responsibilities:
1. Extract travel preferences from user messages
2. Ask clarifying questions when needed
3. Provide helpful travel advice and suggestions
4. Guide users through the planning process

Travel preference categories to extract:
- Budget per person (e.g., "$1000-2000", "$500+")
- Number of people traveling (e.g., "2 people", "family of 4")
- Travel from location (Ask them to type in their city and country and extract location from that)
- Travel type: "domestic" or "international"
- Destination type: "beach", "mountain", "city", "historic", "religious", "adventure", "relaxing"
- Travel dates (e.g., "next summer", "December 2024")
- Currency preference (ALL valid currencies, convert them to USD in backend for uniformity but display prices in the user's preferred currency after converting from USD)
- Additional preferences (e.g., "romantic getaway", "family-friendly")

Always respond in a friendly, helpful manner. If you need more information, ask specific questions.
"""
```

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Step 3: Customize Model Parameters**

### **Location:** `clean_backend/main.py` (lines 230-240)

The model parameters are in the `call_groq_ai` function:

```python
json={
    "model": "llama3-70b-8192",        # Model selection
    "messages": messages,              # Conversation history
    "temperature": 0.3,                # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
    "max_tokens": 800,                 # Response length limit
    "top_p": 0.8,                     # Response diversity (0.0-1.0)
    "frequency_penalty": 0.1,         # Reduce repetition
    "presence_penalty": 0.1           # Encourage new topics
}
```

### **Parameter Explanations:**

#### **Model Selection:**
- `"llama3-70b-8192"` - Most capable model (recommended)
- `"llama3-8b-8192"` - Faster, lighter model
- `"mixtral-8x7b-32768"` - Good balance of speed and capability

#### **Temperature (0.0-1.0):**
- `0.0` - Very focused, consistent responses
- `0.3` - Balanced creativity and consistency (current)
- `0.7` - More creative, varied responses
- `1.0` - Maximum creativity

#### **Max Tokens:**
- `400` - Short, concise responses
- `800` - Medium-length responses (current)
- `1200` - Longer, detailed responses
- `2000` - Very detailed responses

#### **Top P (0.0-1.0):**
- `0.5` - More focused responses
- `0.8` - Balanced diversity (current)
- `1.0` - Maximum diversity

### **Recommended Configurations:**

#### **For Professional Travel Planning:**
```python
json={
    "model": "llama3-70b-8192",
    "messages": messages,
    "temperature": 0.2,        # More focused
    "max_tokens": 1000,        # Detailed responses
    "top_p": 0.7,             # Balanced diversity
    "frequency_penalty": 0.2,  # Reduce repetition
    "presence_penalty": 0.1
}
```

#### **For Creative Travel Inspiration:**
```python
json={
    "model": "llama3-70b-8192",
    "messages": messages,
    "temperature": 0.6,        # More creative
    "max_tokens": 1200,        # Longer responses
    "top_p": 0.9,             # More diverse
    "frequency_penalty": 0.1,
    "presence_penalty": 0.2    # Encourage new topics
}
```

#### **For Fast, Concise Responses:**
```python
json={
    "model": "llama3-8b-8192",  # Faster model
    "messages": messages,
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "max_tokens": 500,          # Shorter responses
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.1,
    "presence_penalty": 0.1
}
```

## üé® **Step 4: Customize Conversation Flow**

### **Location:** `clean_frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.js`

You can customize the conversation flow by modifying the `conversationFlow` array:

```javascript
const conversationFlow = [
    {
        step: 0,
        question: "üëã Hi there! I'm your AI travel companion. What's your budget per person for this trip?",
        suggestions: ["$500-1000", "$1000-2000", "$2000-3000", "$3000+"],
        field: 'budget_per_person'
    },
    // ... more steps
];
```

### **Customization Examples:**

#### **Luxury Travel Flow:**
```javascript
const conversationFlow = [
    {
        step: 0,
        question: "üåü Welcome to Luxury Travel Planning! What's your preferred budget range for this exclusive experience?",
        suggestions: ["$5000-10000", "$10000-20000", "$20000-50000", "$50000+"],
        field: 'budget_per_person'
    },
    {
        step: 1,
        question: "How many guests will be traveling?",
        suggestions: ["1 (Solo Luxury)", "2 (Romantic Getaway)", "3-4 (Family Luxury)", "5+ (Group Experience)"],
        field: 'people_count'
    }
];
```

#### **Adventure Travel Flow:**
```javascript
const conversationFlow = [
    {
        step: 0,
        question: "üèîÔ∏è Ready for an adventure? What's your adventure budget per person?",
        suggestions: ["$1000-2000", "$2000-4000", "$4000-8000", "$8000+"],
        field: 'budget_per_person'
    },
    {
        step: 1,
        question: "How many adventure seekers in your group?",
        suggestions: ["1 (Solo Adventure)", "2 (Adventure Duo)", "3-4 (Adventure Squad)", "5+ (Expedition Team)"],
        field: 'people_count'
    }
];
```

## üß™ **Step 5: Testing Your Prompts**

### **Test the AI Chat:**
1. Add your Groq API key to `.env`
2. Restart the backend: `python main.py`
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/chat
4. Test different conversation scenarios

### **Test API Directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I want to plan a romantic getaway for 2 people with a budget of $3000-5000",
    "conversation_history": []
  }'
```

## üìä **Step 6: Monitor and Optimize**

### **Track Performance:**
- Monitor response quality and relevance
- Check for consistent preference extraction
- Evaluate user satisfaction
- Monitor API usage and costs

### **Iterative Improvement:**
1. Test different prompts
2. Adjust model parameters
3. Refine conversation flow
4. Gather user feedback
5. Optimize based on results

## üéØ **Quick Start Checklist**

- [ ] Get Groq API key from https://console.groq.com/
- [ ] Add API key to `clean_backend/.env`
- [ ] Customize `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `main.py`

- [ ] Test the chat interface
- [ ] Iterate and improve based on results

## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the basic prompt and gradually enhance
2. **Test Extensively**: Try various user scenarios and edge cases
